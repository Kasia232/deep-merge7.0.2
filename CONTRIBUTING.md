# Contributing to `ts-deepmerge`

Contributions to this package are definitely encouraged. If you've identified an issue or an opportunity
for improvement/optimisation, feel free to raise an issue in GitHub or open a PR if you have the solution.

## Making contributions

With any changes, the unit tests must all pass with full coverage. Simply run `yarn test:all` locally
before committing to ensure everything is ok.

If you've added any additional logic, new unit tests must be added to cover the new code branches,
following the conventions in [the existing tests](/src/index.test.ts).

These tests will also be run prior to merging + publishing new versions.
